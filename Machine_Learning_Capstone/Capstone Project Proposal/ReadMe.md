<h1>Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project
</h1>
__________________________________________________________
<h2>Abstract</h2>
This project is part of the Machine Learning Nanodegree Program (MLND for the shorthand). It uses the data from [UCI Machine Learning Respository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29) and it's a supervised learning problem (classification). The goal of this project is to first develop a prediction model regarding whether someone has the disease, then try to find out some key diagnosis indicator (if any).


<h2>Requirements</h2>
Python 2.X will be used for this project, along with following packages:

	* Numpy (Version: 1.13.3)
	* Pandas (Version: 0.12.0)
	* sklearn (Version: 0.19.1)
	* matplotlib (Version: 2.1.0)

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
The dataset to be used in this project was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela, and generously shared by UCI with public through their Machine Learning Repository.
