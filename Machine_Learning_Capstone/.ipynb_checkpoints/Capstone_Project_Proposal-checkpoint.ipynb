    "\n",
    "Cervical cancer caused by uncontrolled growth of cells in the cervix ([Reference](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cervical-cancer/about/what-is-cervical-cancer.html)), its' death rate might be higher than people previously thought it to be ([Reference](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/health/cervical-cancer-death-study/index.html)). In the United States, an estimated number of death of this disease in 2018 for women is up to 4170 ([Reference](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html)). So it's important to find out which key risk factors would signally increase women's chance of developing cervical cancer, as well as to predict whether someone got the disease. So that we can come up with better preventive methods(and diagnostic) to detect the disease earlier, and minimize the death rate of it.  "

    "\n",
    "The data set provides historic medical records (described by few attributes) of 858 patients(The dataset was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela). The goal is first to use the data to train a classfier that can be used to tell whether a patient has this disease when new data flow in, and to tell among all these features, which ones are going to be more predictive (or maybe say informative) than others in diagnosing cervical cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data set is a labeled one (each data point has been labeled 1 for having the disease, 0 for not having the disease), so the problem is binary classification in supervisd learning. A few classification algorithms should be explored in the purpose of finding the most suitable one."
